This paper presents malwares classifier using KNN and malware visualization technique. We used a database of 9339 samples of malwares from 25 families. We calculated the GIST descriptor for grayscale malware images. Then a KNN model was trained and evaluated many times to reach a score of 97%, which is very close to results found on literature.
